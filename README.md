# PacMen
In this repository I changed the name of the main file to indexPac.html so I could embed the file within the pages index file.
This Project is to show function work on how to create a function factory in javascript.
The game basically creates a pac image with the press of a button on the top left of the page.The image displays at a random location with every click.
The start button moves the images at a random direction and velocity. The more clicks the start button located on the top right gets the faster the images move.
This project was intended for educational purposes and will be embedded into the Portfolio main landing page.The back ground was created in Adobe Illustrator by James Visser. I plan to use the functions to create several gif poppers such as a baloon mechanism etc.
